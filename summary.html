        <h2>Dyslexia</h2>
        <p>To give you some background dyslexia is a neurological conditions that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. Dyslexia is best thought of as a continuum, not a distinct category, and there are no clear cut-off points. Those with dyslexia will be affected differently but some of the common areas are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Writing</li>
          <li>Spelling</li>
          <li>Squencing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to understand that not every aspect of dyslexia is bad, and sufferers often excel in other areas. Common strengths that those with dyslexia display are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Innovative thinkers</li>
          <li>Excellent trouble shooters</li>
          <li>Intuitive problem solving</li>
          <li>Creative in may ways</li>
          <li>Lateral thinkers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of this simulation some common issues that children with dyslexia face when reading will be displayed to you. This often involves confusing letters with those that look similar. Some examples of this are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a = o, e</li>
          <li>h = b</li>
          <li>b = p</li>
          <li>w = m</li>
          <li>q = g</li>
          <li>t = i</li>
          <li>n = u</li>
          <li>l = i</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lets see how you go reading some phrase that have been alter to simulate dyslexia.</p>
